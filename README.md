# PHP Formatting tricks
A few php scripts I have made over the years. Often to mangle stuff in Wordpress.

Files and folders you will find here:

A CSV formatter for Country, State, City (in folder /format-csv/)

This script was born out of this stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36783637/how-do-i-convert-this-csv-to-a-better-format-using-php

* format-csv.php << the file that does the mangling
* list.csv << the file that needs mangling
